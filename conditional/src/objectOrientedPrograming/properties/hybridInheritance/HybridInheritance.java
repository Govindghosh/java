//Hybrid Inheritance in Java ðŸš€
//Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance, such as single, hierarchical,
//and multiple inheritance. However, Java does not support hybrid inheritance with classes directly because multiple
//inheritance using classes is not allowed (to avoid ambiguity and the diamond problem).
//But hybrid inheritance can be achieved using interfaces since Java allows multiple inheritance with interfaces.
